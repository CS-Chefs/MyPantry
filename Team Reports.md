### Previous Goals:
- Create the Github repository
- Make a decision on Android Studio or .NET Maui
  - Android Studio: Thomas, Tanner, Alexander
  - .NET Maui: Ethan, Zachary
- Set a good meeting time and place.

### Progress and Issues:
Thomas: Responsible for creating the repository *My Pantry* and organization *CS Chefs*. Invited all team members as collaborators.

After reviewing our IDEs, Android Studio and .NET MAUI, we have discussed our experiences with both of them. We have been intrigued with the ability for Android Studio to emulate what our app would look like. While we were familar with Visual Studio, we found more tutorials under Android Studio since MAUI is newly developed. We had all agreed that **Android Studio** may be our best bet.

We have also decided to meet and discuss our progress and issues every Friday at 5 PM at the 206 STEM building.

### Next Weeks goals:
We will brainstorm the requirements that our app should have.
We have looked into Requirements document and decided our roles for the instructions.

1. Ethan: Introduction, including Team info & policies
2. Tanner: Product description
3. Thomas: External Requirements
4. Everyone: Use Cases (Functional Requirements)
5. Zachary: Non-functional Requirements
6. Alex: Team Process Description

5. Zachary: Non-functional Requirements
6. Alex: Team Process Description

### Progress and Issues:
On this meeting we went over our templates for what our final Requirements doc will eventually look like and assigned our roles to develop a use case based on our features and stretch goals we had brainstormed in our previous meeting. The location for our meetings has moved to ~~206~~ 420 STEM with key access.

#### Major features of this app are the following:  
- An editable list of ingredients that the user has in stock. **(_TBD_)**  
- A recipe database that can be browsed using filters. **Tanner Dull**  
- Filters for the database can be either by ingredients the user has in stock or by preferences such as allergens and genre. **(_TBD_)**  
- The ability to “use” a recipe which will automatically deduct the used ingredients from those that are in stock. **Zach Padalino**  
- A grocery list that the user can add and remove items from. **Ethan Forsha**  
- A notification system for when the user has less than a predetermined amount of an ingredient. **Thomas Birt**  
- Key as recipes, ingredients (Example: *A) spaghetti, B) Meatballs*)

#### Stretch goals of this app are the following:  
- A freshness timer that notifies the user when their ingredients are approaching their expiration date. **Ethan Forsha**  
- A calorie counter that logs the number of calories per dish. **Tanner Dull**  
- The ability to allow the user to add custom recipes to the recipe database. **Zach Padalino**  
- A wattage converter that will allow the users to know how long to cook recipes at a certain wattage. **Thomas Birt**  

### Next Weeks goals:
Each team member will have their very own branch to develop on. We will finish our own use cases we have *assigned ourselves above*. We will eventually finish our Requirements document this week.

## September 30, 2022

### Previous Goals:
Each team member will have their very own branch to develop on. We will finish our own use cases we have *assigned ourselves above*. We will eventually finish our Requirements document this week.

### Progress and Issues:
With a incoming deadline due on **Oct 3** for the Requirements document, we have discussed on revising one of our use cases which would be our notification system for when the user has reached below a predetermined amount of an ingredient. The problem with this would be that it's unrealistic. We wouldn't have an exact amount to deduct from the ingredient when we want to use it for our recipe, the user could use too much or too little of an ingredient. We still have decided to keep the "using the recipe" function to deduct the recipe's ingredient to a rounded amount for simplicity. 

Ethan Forsha has recommended that we could add the following requirements to our document:
- Creating an account
- Login to application
- Pantry Inventory (for interactions with adding, removing, and editing ingredients/items)
- Checking off ingredients from our Grocery List to our digital Pantry Inventory

### Next Weeks goals:
We will have published the MyPantry Requirements document and look forward towards the architecture and design of MyPantry. Each team member is assigned a role on the MyPantry application (*subject to change*):

- **Alexander Sanchez:** SRS team process description, editable ingredients list requirement, preferences/filter requirement.
- **Ethan Forsha:** SRS introduction, formatting, create account requirement, login requirement, add item requirement, delete item requirement, view inventory requirement, and expiration date requirement.
- **Tanner Dull:** SRS product description, browse recipes requirement, add calories requirement, view calories requirement, and view recipe requirement.
- **Thomas Birt:** Weekly team reports, SRS external requirements, edit item requirement, checkoff item requirement, wattage converter requirement, and low ingredient notification requirement.
- **Zachary Padalino:** SRS nonfunctional and other requirements, use recipe requirement, and add custom recipe requirement.

### Progress and Issues:
We have each created a new branch on our newly pinned GitHub repository (*not able to work on old repository without Android Studio files added*), assigned ourselves each a role on designing each application page & document, visualized each sketch on our Login, Home, Grocery List, and Pantry Inventory page including every feature implemented in each page.

### Next Weeks goals:
- Watch tutorials on Android Studio
- Pull recipes from an online database
  - **OR** create a sample database using Android Studio's **SQLite**
- Create a layout within each app page
- Merge branches when complete

#### Assigned Roles
Each team member is assigned a role on the following application pages to be designed:

- **Thomas Birt:** Grocery List
- **Ethan Forsha:** Pantry Inventory
- **Alexander Sanchez:** Primary Recipe Database
- **Zachary Padalino:** User Profile, Login, Create Account
- **Tanner Dull:** Home page, Recipes page

Each team member is assigned a role on the MyPantry **Architecture & Design** document:

1. **Ethan Forsha:** Software Architecture
2. **Tanner Dull:** Coding Guidelines
3. **Thomas Birt:** Component Design
4. **Zachary Padalino:** User Interface Design
5. **Alexander Sanchez:** Process Descriptions (Revisions and Updates)
6. **EVERYONE:** Use Case Specification Achievement

### Previous Goals:
- Watch tutorials on Android Studio
- Pull recipes from an online database
  - **OR** create a sample database using Android Studio's **SQLite**
- Create a layout within each app page
- Merge branches when complete

### Progress and Issues:
Almost everyone should be able to have a basic layout of their designed page complete. For now, we're sticking with creating a sample database using **SQLite**. We will focus on pushing the UI and overall functionality to master branch when complete, as well as directing a page to one another. Everyone should have their layout named activity_(page).xml. Example: **activity_pantryinventory.xml**

### Next Weeks goals:
Pull all finished layouts into one file, work on **Architecture & Design** document, finish the created database.
